  [ "After a frantic nighttime search throughout Arkham, you have tracker\
    \ down and questioned several members of the cult. Your findings are\
    \ disturbing: they claim to worship a being known as Umôrdhoth, a\
    \ monstrous entity from another realm."
  , "You are able to confirm much of Lita’s story: the cult is agitated over\
    \ the destruction of a ghoul lair. However, a surprising detail also turns\
    \ up: the one who invaded the lair and set this night’s events in motion\
    \ was none other than Lita Chantler herself! You are not sure why this\
    \ important detail was omitted from Lita’s story—did she tell you only\
    \ as much as was necessary to draw you into her conflict? But in another\
    \ light, she seems to be fighting to protect the city of Arkham from a\
    \ terrible menace."
  , "The final piece of the puzzle was found written in a journal possessed by\
    \ one of the cultists. It describes a dark ritual to be performed deep within\
    \ the woods south of Arkham, this very night. According to the journal,\
    \ the ritual’s completion will open a gate and bring forth the cult’s dark\
    \ master into this world. “If the cult is not stopped,” Lita warns, “there is\
    \ a possibility that Umôrdhoth’s vengeance will consume all in its path.”\
    \ Frightened but determined to stop the ritual, you head into the woods…"
