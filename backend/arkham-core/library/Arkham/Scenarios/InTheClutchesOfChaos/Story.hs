    [ "After what you saw at the Unvisited Isle, your faith in humanity is on thin\
      \ ice. You feel like a wayward spirit, wandering the streets with no destination\
      \ in mind. You wish you could just return home and forget everything that has\
      \ happened in the last few weeks, but you know that is just a pipe dream. After\
      \ hours of aimless meandering, you snap back to reality when you realize you have\
      \ wandered into Independence Square. A soft breeze carries a trail of brittle\
      \ leaves across the grass of the clearing, drawing your eyes upward. There,\
      \ sitting amidst a circle of autumn-colored leaves, sits Anna Kaslow. Her eyes\
      \ are closed in a deep trance, her fingers pressed against the temples of her\
      \ head. Laid out on the grass in front of her is a wool blanket, and on top of\
      \ that, a circle of overlapping facedown tarot cards. You approach and take a\
      \ seat in front of the fortune teller. It’s only now that you realize just how\
      \ sore and tired you are. Every one of your muscles aches with pain, and it takes\
      \ a significant amount of effort for you to not immediately pass out."

    [ "You recognize the soothsayer from your investigation into the disappearances at\
      \ Josef Meiger’s manor. It was her advice that led the second set of victims to\
      \ their doom, or so you suspect. Oddly enough, she appears to recognize you, as\
      \ well. She runs her fingers along the circle of cards before her. “I suspect the\
      \ past few weeks have been quite arduous for you. Are you here for guidance?” You\
      \ grimace. The last time Anna read somebody’s fortune, it did not end well for\
      \ them. What makes you think you will be any different?"

    [ "Anna opens her eyes. “I was wondering when we would meet again.” You wonder\
      \ aloud how she could possibly not know, when everything else she has predicted\
      \ has come to pass. Your remark earns you a hearty chuckle from the soothsayer.\
      \ “That doesn’t mean I know everything, my dear.” She runs her fingers across the\
      \ circle of cards. “I suspect the past few weeks have been quite arduous for you.\
      \ Are you here for more guidance?” You grimace. This all began with a reading of\
      \ your fortune. What makes you think another reading will make this all go away?"

    [ "Before you can answer, Anna turns over the card closest to her. It depicts a\
      \ furtive hooded figure with five swords embedded in the ground around it. Others\
      \ cower and flee before the victorious figure, and a maelstrom of dark clouds\
      \ brew over its head. Above this image, the card reads: FIVE OF SWORDS. “You may\
      \ feel as though you have been defeated, but you must not give in to despair. The\
      \ battle may be over, but your struggle has not yet ended.” Misery catches in\
      \ your throat. You want nothing more than for this nightmare to be over, but\
      \ Anna’s words ring true: you know it will not end unless you put an end to it\
      \ yourself."
    , "A flash of light burns across the sky, followed swiftly by a resounding crack\
      \ of thunder. The clouds above are not natural. Phantasmal shapes shift and churn\
      \ within the mist above. If you listen closely, you can faintly hear their howls\
      \ of pain and sadness drifting on the wind. “It has begun,” Anna utters quietly.\
      \ You rise to your feet, ignoring your exhaustion, your pain, and your fear."
