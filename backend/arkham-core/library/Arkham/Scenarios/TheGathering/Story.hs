  \ your house with your lives. The woman from your parlor\
  \ follows you out the front door, slamming it behind her. “You\
  \ fools! See what you have done?” She pushes a chair in front of\
  \ the door, lodging it beneath the doorknob. “We must get out\
  \ of here. Come with me, and I will tell you what I know. We\
  \ are the only ones who can stop the threat that lurks beneath\
  \ from being unleashed throughout the city.” You’re in no state\
  \ to argue. Nodding, you follow the woman as she runs from\
  \ your front porch out into the rainy street, toward Rivertown."

  \ in the inferno. From the sidewalk, you watch as everything\
  \ you own is consumed by the flames. “Come with me,” the\
  \ woman says. “You must be told of the threat that lurks below.\
  \ Alone, we are surely doomed…but together, we can stop it.”"

  \ a grave mistake!” she warns. “You do not understand the\
  \ threat that lurks below…the grave danger we are all in!”\
  \ Still shaken by the night’s events, you decide to hear the\
  \ woman out. Perhaps she can shed some light on these bizarre\
  \ events…but she doesn’t seem to trust you very much."
