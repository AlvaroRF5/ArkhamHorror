  [ "Several months have passed since The\
    \ King in Yellow came to the Ward Theatre. You\
    \ and your companions have been investigating\
    \ the strange incidents that followed in its wake.\
    \ What you have found makes you question the wisdom of continuing\
    \ your investigation, but the truth calls out to you, and you cannot help\
    \ but answer. It seems you weren’t the first to piece together the strange\
    \ happenings surrounding The King in Yellow. Another group of\
    \ investigators had been researching these events as well. Just a matter\
    \ of days after the performance in Arkham, they were admitted to the\
    \ asylum, ranting about the King’s return and the “monsters” that had\
    \ attacked them. Somehow this doesn’t surprise you. Their fate makes\
    \ you all the more certain you are on the right trail... And all the more\
    \ certain that you should stop while you still have the chance."
  , "You’ve found the records those investigators kept before their\
    \ incarceration, and picked up the trail where they left off. They had\
    \ interviewed some of the cast and crew of The King in Yellow, and\
    \ discovered several pieces of vital information. Their research also\
    \ contains notes about their discoveries in Arkham’s Historical Society,\
    \ and accounts from their time spent in the asylum, including interactions\
    \ with a patient named “Daniel Chesterfield.” After a long night of\
    \ compiling and comparing notes, you fall into a deep slumber. In your\
    \ dreams, you are subjected to visions of Carcosa—its black stars, twin\
    \ suns, shattered moons, and twisted spires."

  [ "It has been several weeks since the events in the asylum, and\
    \ you are still no closer to the truth about The King in Yellow and\
    \ Carcosa. You have scoured the city for signs of the others Daniel had\
    \ mentioned—the ones who are “opening the path to Carcosa”—but\
    \ found nothing. Either the trail has gone cold, or they’re no longer in\
    \ Arkham. Perhaps Daniel truly was insane, and you are only following\
    \ him deeper down the rabbit hole. Every night, you toss and turn as you\
    \ are subjected to vivid dreams of Carcosa—its black stars, twin suns,\
    \ shattered moons, and twisted spires."
