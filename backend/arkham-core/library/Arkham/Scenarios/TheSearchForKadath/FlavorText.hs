      \ cat’s warning about danger in the waking world, and you wonder about the\
      \ others who have followed Virgil Gray down the steps of slumber and through\
      \ the Enchanted Woods. Are they here now, too? Perhaps if you find this\

      \ the dawn light. You recognize the shape as Virgil’s talking cat. You ask\
      \ the black cat how long it has been sitting there."

      \ Dreamlands? If so, where would their minds go? Curious, you pose this\
      \ question to the cat."
    , "“Those here in their physical bodies can, but you are something else\
      \ entirely. Now, never mind all that. On to business.” The black cat leaps\
      \ onto your bed. “I gave your friends the warning you wanted me to pass\
      \ along. They are preparing to enter the Dreamlands as well, it seems. In the\
      \ meantime, I will stay with you. Somebody has to watch over you and my pet\

      \ After all, this is not your first excursion into the fabled land of dreams.\
      \ Addressing Randolph, you suggest talking to the high priest Atal in the\
      \ nearby Temple of the Elder Ones. It is a name you heard the last time you\
      \ visited the city of Ulthar in your sleep, though until now you had no\
      \ reason to seek the priest’s advice. Randolph gives you a startled glance\
      \ that transforms quickly into a smirk."

      \ crowning the highest hill in town. A small army of cats patrols its walls.\
      \ The cat at the head of the formation is none other than the old cat with\
      \ the scar you encountered in the woods earlier. He steps forward to bar your\

      \ place we seek.” You wonder aloud how far the temple is from here."

      \ don’t seem the type to make trouble. ’Sides, I ain’t goin’ nowhere.” You\
      \ see a small lump in front of the cat: a bloodied, half-eaten pheasant. You\
      \ resist the urge to turn up your nose and count yourself lucky you are on\

      \ cats guarding the temple surround you. You don’t wish to harm these cats,\
      \ but you won’t let them block you from your objective, either. Nodding to\
      \ your companions, you make a mad dash for the temple gates. A storm of\
      \ hisses and angry screeches erupts all around you as the cats mount a\
      \ desperate defense. A wall of tiny claws and teeth meets you, but you push\
      \ through, defiant. You slam the stone door shut behind you and hear the old\

      \ of the Great Ones, high above unknown Kadath. Even I know not its true\
      \ location. And that is all well and good, for the fruits of attempting to\
      \ ascend to such a place would be bitter indeed. My companion Barzai once\
      \ scaled a peak only a fraction as sacred, and he was never seen nor heard\
      \ from again. The gods of Kadath may seem powerless, but they are protected\
      \ by the Other Gods from the Outside, whom it is better not to discuss. It\
      \ would be wiser to let all the gods alone and leave this folly behind.”"

      \ Earth, for this land is but a reflection of yours.”"

      \ offering draught after draught to the priest. Eventually, Atal’s lips\
      \ loosen, and he speaks of forbidden things he would never discuss were it\
      \ not for the wine. He tells of an image carved into the face of the mountain\
      \ Ngranek on the isle of Oriab—the likeness of the gods, or so he claims. He\
      \ tells of the pillars of Kadatheron wherein the history of Earth’s\
      \ Dreamlands is recorded. He tells of those slain by the hordes of Night\
      \ itself and interred in the crypts of Zulan-Thek, the city of the dead. He\
      \ tells of a baleful star above a forgotten city that appears on no map. “If\
      \ you absolutely must seek Kadath in the Cold Wastes,” he says drowsily,\
