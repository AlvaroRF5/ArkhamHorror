  [ "The silver-blue flames that have guided you through these passages are the\
    \ only vestige of hope you have remaining. One by one, the braziers lead you\
    \ onward. Someone or something placed these devices here. The technology is not\
    \ unlike what you have seen in the caverns of Kâ€™n-yan, or in the Eztli ruins\
    \ where the relic was first found. However, it seems whoever ventured this deep\
    \ below the crust of the Earth must have turned and fled, for the final brazier\
    \ has been toppled and broken, and you see no more of them ahead.  Thankfully,\
    \ you do not need to travel in the darkness for very long. Within minutes, you\
    \ come upon a huge stone doorway: no doubt the entrance to the Nexus."

    \ with part of your body pressed against the cavern wall, using the cold stone to\
    \ navigate without losing course. As you travel, your fingers find warm, smooth\
    \ grooves along the wall: the same dormant technology that existed in the Eztli\
    \ ruins. You are clearly not the first to enter this abyssal place. However,\
    \ whoever came here before you must have fled before their work was done, since\
    \ the channels did not light to guide your way or glare with anger as you\
    \ approached. Hours pass as you make your way gradually in the dark, until\
    \ finally you come upon a huge stone doorway: no doubt the entrance to the Nexus."

    \ warning to turn back, for to open this passage is to invite doom. It is too\
    \ dark to recognize the language, but you know it is not one spoken by humanity\
    \ in this day and age. You have no idea how you can understand the engraving.\
    \ Perhaps some last remnant of memory from your time in Pnakotus, lost city of\
    \ the Yithians. Or perhaps you are truly mad, discerning meaning from natural\
    \ indentations in the stone wall. After all, it has been almost a week since you\
    \ have seen natural light."

    \ accord. You grip the artifact tightly and enter."
