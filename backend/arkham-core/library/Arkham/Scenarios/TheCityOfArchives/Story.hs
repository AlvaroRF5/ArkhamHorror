  [ "You remember very little of the next few days. Your consciousness fades in and\
    \ out as your body grips with exhaustion, and your mind feebly attempts to\
    \ comprehend what exactly has happened to you."
  , "The inhabitants of this place are the same creatures you saw Alejandro\
    \ consorting with: immense corrugated cones of clammy flesh, with four thick\
    \ limbs extending from the top. They are horrifying to look upon, but they do not\
    \ harm you as you expected they might. Your first few days are spent restrained\
    \ and questioned by the creatures, several of which are somehow able to\
    \ communicate in English. Others reproduce your language using an odd futuristic\
    \ machine, played like a musical instrument. You are reminded strangely of the\
    \ jazz piano at the Nightingale. It is only then that you realize your body has\
    \ been altered. You have no hands or fingers to play the keys, no legs to walk\
    \ upon, no lungs to scream out. You are one of them now, one of the creatures\
    \ that has taken you captive, and your original body is nowhere to be seen."
  , "Despite your captivity, the creatures do not seem intent on harming you.\
    \ Instead, they merely interview you, asking all manner of questions about a\
    \ broad range of topics: your society, your profession, your technology, your\
    \ ecosystem, your human body. Their thirst for knowledge is unyielding, unending.\
    \ Their questions range from the mundane to the complex. They implore you to\
    \ write copiously in your own language, taking anything you write to store away\
    \ in their vast archives. You are informed that you will be able to roam the city\
    \ freely if you comply."

  [ "You cooperate with the creatures, hoping to earn your freedom. You are sick of\
    \ captivity, and perhaps you will be able to find a way home if you are able to\
    \ roam the city at will. The creatures seem pleased that you are answering their\
    \ questions, though their mannerisms are still completely alien to you. Days turn\
    \ to weeks, perhaps even longer. It is difficult to tell. Finally, one of the\
    \ creatures informs you that you are free to roam the halls of the city, with\
    \ several restrictions: You are not allowed to do harm to your new body, for it\
    \ belongs to another of their race, and you are not allowed to leave the city.\
    \ Your restraints are lifted, and the creature watches with keen interest as you\
    \ get used to your conical body."

  [ "These creatures abducted you and even stole you from your own body. You refuse\
    \ to give your captors even a single answer. You’d spit in their faces if you\
    \ could—if you knew how to spit with such body, and if you knew which one of the\
    \ creatures’ four distensible appendages was a face.  Breaking free of your\
    \ restrains is a hopeless endeavor, but you struggle to escape regardless. Your\
    \ efforts do not go unnoticed, and one of the creatures is assigned to watch you.\
    \ It seems more concerned with preventing you from harming your body than\
    \ preventing you from escaping. After many days of captivity, you find a way to\
    \ use this to your advantage. You struggle so hard against your restraints that\
    \ they pierce into your leathery, cold flesh, drawing out a bit of viscous\
    \ slime-blood. Your guard quickly apporoaches, clicking its claws together\
    \ repeatedly. It undoes your restraints, and the moment it does, your claw\
    \ appendages strike at what you believe to be the creature’s throat. It collapses\
    \ to the floor, writhing in pain."
