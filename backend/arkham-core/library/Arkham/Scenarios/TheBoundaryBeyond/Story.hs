  [ "Rays of hot yellow sunlight beat down on you from above as your car speeds down\
    \ the dusty highways of southern Texas, just outside of San Antonio. It has been\
    \ several days since you hit the road from Arkham on your way to Mexico City,\
    \ where you may be able to get answers from some of Alejandro’s associates—or\
    \ even better, from his adversaries in academia. Your recent investigations in\
    \ Arkham uncovered much, but despite all the knowledge you laid bare, the trail\
    \ went cold soon after. The “Brotherhood” that you exposed in Arkham has all but\
    \ vanished from the city. Its members left behind little information as to their\
    \ next objective, other than the name “The Nexus of N’kai,” a place of power that\
    \ Ichtaca believes is the Brotherhood’s ultimate destination. Enigmatic as ever,\
    \ the Eztli warrior sits in the passenger seat next to you. She is tense and\
    \ coiled like a spring, the Ford’s leather seat offering her little comfort."

  (Just "Ichtaca's Quest")
  [ "“How close are we?” Ichtaca asks for the hundredth time since departing from\
    \ Arkham. “We have to get to Anahuac as fast as we can. The longer we take, the\
    \ more time the Brotherhood has to reach the Nexus.” You recognize the old Aztec\
    \ name for the Valley of Mexico, and inform Ichtaca that you will be crossing the\
    \ border into Mexico within the hour. She crosses her arms and grits her teeth."

  (Just "Silent Journey")
  [ "Ichtaca is quiet and pensive for the majority of your journey. Your questions\
    \ are met with a wall of silence and a steely glare. Whatever she has planned,\
    \ you are being left in the dark."

  (Just "Arcane Thrumming")
  [ "Throughout the journey south, the device you recovered from the clutches of the\
    \ Brotherhood continues its endless humming, wrapped in a thin bedsheet on the\
    \ back seat of your car. Your understanding of the relic’s nature is deepening."

  (Just "Growing Concern")
  [ "The loss of the Eztli relic weighs heavily on your mind. Clearly, its value is\
    \ more than simply academic. It holds a power within it that you cannot yet begin\
    \ to fathom. You are certain that the shadowy Brotherhood is behind its\
    \ disappearance, but for what purpose?"

alejandrosThoughts :: FlavorText
alejandrosThoughts = FlavorText
  (Just "Alejandro's Throughts")
  [ "Throughout your journey, Alejandro scribbles endlessly in his journal, the\
    \ sound of pencil scratching against paper a constant reminder of his presence.\
    \ He remains huddled in the back seat of the car, his knees keeping the journal\
    \ still, his brows furrowed in thought. “This ‘Brotherhood’ is the least of our\
    \ concerns,” he says with an air of finality. “I’ve been trying to decrypt the\
    \ glyphs the device bears. The symbols are clearly not Aztec, nor Mayan, nor are\
    \ they from any other Mesoamerican civilization, for that matter. I believe there\
    \ is some other place the relic belongs. Somewhere it was taken from. Wouldn’t\
    \ you agree, Miss Ichtaca?”"
  , "Ichtaca’s already-grim expression grows darker, her eyes narrowing. She doesn’t\
    \ bother to turn around in her seat before addressing Alejandro. “It belongs\
    \ somewhere meddlesome scholars cannot abuse its power,” she replies in a cold\
    \ tone, and that is the end of the discussion."
  , "Crossing the border into Mexico is a less stressful endeavor than you imagined\
    \ it to be, due to Alejandro’s connections. You are waved through customs with\
    \ nary a stray glance, and soon enough, you are on your way to Mexico City."

  [ "Somewhere just north of the border, you stop to rest for the night. Your eyes\

    \ now."

  (Just "Out of Gas")
  [ "Fuel is a constant concern throughout your journey south. You are able to\
    \ refuel several times along the way at general and hardware stores, but\
    \ eventually your car putters out along the side of the road, just north of the\
    \ southern border. You and Ichtaca are forced to walk several miles to the\
    \ nearest town to refuel, setting you back several hours."

  [ "After arriving in Mexico City, you are disheartened to find very little\
    \ information regarding the Brotherhood or the Nexus. You peruse the archives of\
    \ the city’s libraries and universities, but come up empty- handed. You can’t\
    \ find any of Alejandro’s former colleagues in the city, and even his enemies\
    \ refuse to speak to you, save for one: a woman named Padma Amrita, who studied\
    \ Alejandro’s work before he came to Arkham. She agrees to meet you at a trendy\
    \ lounge in the southern part of the city, late at night. Ichtaca remains a short\
    \ distance away, observing your new informant silently."
  , "Padma knows a lot about Alejandro’s research, and even claims to have heard of\
    \ the Nexus of N’kai, though she refuses to tell you how to find it. “It is a\
    \ fool’s errand,” she tells you. “There is nothing to find. Just a myth. Trust\
    \ me, many have searched for it. None have found it.” You point out that the\
    \ Eztli people were not a myth, and she responds with a charming smile. “Perhaps\
    \ not, but all this about the Eztli still being alive? Undiscovered for\
    \ centuries?” She laughs heartily. “Bushwa, pure and simple. Come now, you don’t\
    \ expect real scholars to believe that, do you?” Your eyes are drawn to Ichtaca,\
    \ who is overhearing the conversation with crossed arms, her nails dug into her\
    \ forearms. Padma’s eyes wander over as well, the hint of a smirk on her lips.\
    \ “In any event, I apologize, but I don’t have any information for you. Only a\
    \ sap would continue this ‘research’ any further. Good day.” Padma leaves with\
    \ another alluring smile, a sweet scent trailing behind her as she departs."
  , "Once she is out of sight, Ichtaca sits down next to you, and you discuss your\
    \ next move. After a week of failure after failure, she has grown impatient. You\
    \ offer a few more suggestions regarding whom you could speak to next, but her\
    \ mind is elsewhere. When you return to your hotel, she immediately retreats to\
    \ her room to make preparations for tomorrow. You decide to settle in for the\
    \ night, and before long, your mind is meandering hazily into a dreamless\
    \ slumber. In the far recesses of your awareness, however, you can hear Ichtaca\
    \ reciting a cryptic incantation..."
