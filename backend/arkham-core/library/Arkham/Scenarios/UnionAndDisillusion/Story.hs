    [ "The Unvisited Isle lies in the midst of the Miskatonic River, in between two of\
      \ the bridges that span the river and connect the Downtown and Rivertown\
      \ neighborhoods of Arkham. Overgrown with vines, thorns, and unnatural\
      \ underbrush, the island is home to no residents and very few fauna. Rows of\
      \ mysterious stone pillars stand sentry throughout the island, rising high above\
      \ the treetops. Though many theories abound, none know for sure what purpose\
      \ these stone pillars serve, or who built them. Very few dare to venture onto the\
      \ shores of the enigmatic island, and those who do return with strange tales:\
      \ bonfires in the woods at the darkest hours of night—stone altars with deep\
      \ carvings impossible Setup to translate—empty woods devoid of life, save for the\
      \ stark-black ravens and whippoorwills who perch on the tree branches and watch\
      \ trespassers with eager eyes. Unfortunately for you, the stakes are too high for\
      \ you to heed these many warnings."
    , "The streets of Arkham are emptier and quieter than you have ever seen them\
      \ before. A familiar grey mist has enveloped the town. The haze grows denser and\
      \ thicker the closer you get to the river. You move with haste, not wanting to\
      \ encounter any others on your way to the site of the ritual, whether they be\
      \ living or dead. You find several rowboats moored by the docks and climb aboard\
      \ one of them. With the waters unnaturally still and barely any current carrying\
      \ the boat, rowing toward the island should be a simple endeavor. Even so, the\
      \ dense fog makes it difficult for you to get your bearings. Soon, you are\
      \ completely enclosed by the grey mist, unable to see the banks of the river or\
      \ the coast of the island. Shapes emerge from the fog. Ripples appear on the\
      \ surface of the water. The gaze of the watcher is upon you."
    , "Just then, a pillar of spectral energy ascends into the sky, clear as day even\
      \ through the haze. The shapes all turn their attention to this beacon, and you\
      \ sense the watcher’s gaze slipping from your soul. The rite has begun. You row\
      \ faster, using the light to guide you. It is time to decide once and for all why\
      \ you have come—are you here to aid the Silver Twilight Lodge? Or to disrupt\
      \ them?"
