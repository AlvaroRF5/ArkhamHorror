  [ "It is a breezy November evening in Arkham—the perfect night for a walk through\
    \ Independence Square, or so you had thought, up until the moment Anna Kaslow\
    \ offered to tell your fortune. You agreed, though you would soon come to regret\
    \ this decision. For each of the cards the Romani soothsayer draws from her deck,\
    \ she weaves a tale of despair and misfortune.  Judgment. Temperance. Justice.\
    \ The Hermit. The Hanged Man. The Hierophant. The Lovers. The Chariot. The Wheel\
    \ of Fortune. To complete her tale, Anna draws the top card and lays it in the\
    \ center of the formation. Dominating the old, worn card is the ominous image of\
    \ a towering construct of black onyx. A hellish storm rages over the tower,\
    \ lightning coursing through the dark clouds. It reads: THE TOWER · XVI. Even if\
    \ the rest of the reading had gone swimmingly, the sight of the center card would\
    \ have sent a shiver down your spine. As it stands now, it feels more like the\
    \ closing of a casket over your body."
  , "“You did tell me to give it to you straight,” the soothsayer says. She sits\
    \ cross-legged in front of you, wearing a stony, grim expression. From her\
    \ unwavering gaze and her cold eyes, you can tell Anna derives no satisfaction\
    \ from this reading. “Simple misfortune is the least of your concerns,” she\
    \ explains. “This is a matter of life and death.” She motions to the cards\
    \ surrounding The Tower—each of them laid in the reverse position—and stares at\
    \ them intently. “Arrayed against you is everything that you cannot see. You\
    \ alone stand in their way,” she says enigmatically."

  [ "The woman nods and draws the top card of the deck with a steady hand, revealing\
    \ it to you without looking at it herself. Depicted on the card is a single\
    \ wooden wand, surrounded by a pattern of broken stained glass. It reads: ACE OF\
    \ RODS. “You must be ready to act,” she advises. “Without hesitation. Without\
    \ regret. When the opportunity arises, you must set into motion the events that\
    \ will change this fate.”"

  [ "The woman smirks. “Yes, in a sense, I suppose it is,” she responds. With a\
    \ single swift motion, she picks up each of the cards displayed before you, save\
    \ for The Tower card, and shuffles them back into the deck. “The cards only\
    \ reveal and advise. They cannot influence or impose.” She locks eyes with you,\
    \ and her smile vanishes from her face. “In other words, though your fate is not\
    \ set in stone, I assure you the danger you face is not ‘bullshit.’ It is real.”\
    \ Her eyes narrow. “It is very real.”"

  [ "Silence hangs in the air as you peer into The Tower card. The world around you\
    \ dissolves into emptiness as your eyes fixate on the onyx tower. Rolling thunder\
    \ echoes in the distance. “Do you understand now?” Anna asks. There is no other\
    \ sign of the soothsayer: only her strained voice. A bolt of lightning streaks\
    \ across the sky. “Do you see your fate before you, as I do?”"
  , "Another resounding crack of thunder, and you are suddenly awake. Icy rain pelts\
    \ your body, soaking you through to the bone. You are lying in the mud beside a\
    \ wooded trail, and there is no other soul in sight..."
