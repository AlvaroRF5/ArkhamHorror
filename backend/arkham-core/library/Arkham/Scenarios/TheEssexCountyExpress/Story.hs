    \ simultaneously terrifying and impossible to recall with clarity.\
    \ A hypnotic spectacle of lights, otherworldly sensations, and\
    \ altered geometry dances at the tattered edges of your mind. An\
    \ unearthly voice from beyond rings in your ears, its significance\
    \ an enigma. When you awaken, you find yourself in the woods,\
    \ several miles from the Miskatonic River. Destroyed train cars\
    \ surround you. They are crumpled as if from a severe impact;\
    \ they are also decayed as if years of rust and squalor have\
    \ claimed them. There is no sign of the other passengers."

    \ the train collapses harmlessly upon itself. The few passengers\
    \ who survived the ordeal seem unable to comprehend what\
    \ just happened. One passenger mentions “a pipe bursting in\
    \ the rear car,” and that quickly becomes the explanation for\
    \ the innocent and ignorant, those who either cannot or choose\
    \ not to delve further into the mystery. You, on the other hand,\
    \ know better… although in hindsight, you wish you didn’t."
