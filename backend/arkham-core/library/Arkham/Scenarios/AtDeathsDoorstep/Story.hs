  , "Residents of French Hill are still in a tizzy after the sudden disappearance of\
    \ several guests and house staff from the home of Mr. Josef Meiger during the\
    \ night of the annual Silver Twilight charity gala last Sunday. “We are\
    \ absolutely baffled as to how this could have happened,” said Mr. Meiger the day\
    \ after the disappearances. “That said, we are confident that Sheriff Engle and\
    \ the Arkham Police will do their due diligence in finding the missing persons.”"
  , "There is still no evidence whatsoever as to the whereabouts of Miss Gavriella\
    \ Mizrah, Mr. Jerome Davids, Mr. Valentino Rivas, and Mrs. Penny White, all of\
    \ whom vanished halfway through the event and have not been seen since. The\
    \ police are offering a substantial reward for any person or persons who come\
    \ forward with information related to these disappearances. When asked whether\
    \ the police were considering the case a homicide, Sheriff Engle had this to say:\
    \ “There’s no reason to suspect foul play is involved just yet. However, given\
    \ the circumstances, we have to consider every possibility.” No other attendees\
    \ have come forward with statements concerning the gala, which seemed to finish\
    \ without a hitch despite the disappearances."
  , "So far, none of the prominent members of the Silver Twilight Lodge have\
    \ expressed any concern about the Lodge’s upcoming benefit dinner, which was\
    \ recently moved to the same location: Josef Meiger’s estate in French Hill. “I\
    \ am certain that this event will be a smashing success,” Mr. Meiger told the\
    \ Arkham Advertiser in an interview yesterday. “There is no reason for the fair\
    \ residents of Arkham to worry.”"

    \ files you’ve collected over the last few days concerning the missing persons.\
    \ It has been several days since your experience in the woods. You have tried to\
    \ put it all out of mind, but it is impossible. Every night, you dream of a\
    \ nameless place in the void of space, a faint discordant melody of hypnotizing\
    \ flutes pulling you forward. Now there are others disappearing from the town\
    \ without a trace. The disappearances dance along the edges of your thoughts. No\
    \ reason to worry, you ponder, turning the man’s words over in your head. You\
    \ think of the card reader and her warning, and you wonder if you are simply\
    \ imagining devils where there are none. Regardless, there is only one way to\
    \ know for sure. You pick up the invitation, examining the silver-embossed\
    \ stationary and perfect calligraphy."

  [ "The entry hall to the manor is beautifully decorated, but you find it odd that\
    \ the grand staircase’s wooden balustrade has been recently repaired and, by the\
    \ looks of it, hastily so. While nobody is looking, you follow the handrail up\
    \ and down the stairs until you spot what you are looking for: several splinters\
    \ of wood, perhaps dislodged by a bullet. You ascend the staircase once more and\
    \ position yourself where one would need to be standing in order to fire such a\
    \ shot. After a moment of observation, a faint glimmer near one of the decorative\
    \ ferns on the second floor catches your eye. There, you find proof: a bullet\
    \ casing from a .45 handgun. A gun was indeed fired in the entry hall of the\
    \ manor—but if that is true, how did nobody hear the shots?"

    \ he’s been scrubbing evidence of some wrongdoing. You find nothing of note in\
    \ any of Josef ’s files, but after some perusing, you realize there is one place\
    \ you haven’t checked: the trash. Rooting through the garbage bin yields fruit.\
    \ Near the bottom is a small pocket journal belonging to Jerome Davids, probably\
    \ tossed there carelessly by the cleaning staff. You turn to the last page.\
    \ There, Jerome had recorded a list of names, perhaps transcribed from Josef’s\
    \ records. You don’t know what it means yet, but it must be important."

  [ "The balcony outside Josef Meiger’s bedroom overlooks the rainy streets and\
    \ somber spires of French Hill. According to eyewitnesses, Penny was last seen\
    \ entering Josef ’s bedroom, presumably to tidy it up, or perhaps to look for one\
    \ of his personal belongings. The cigarette butt on the floor of the balcony\
    \ tells a different story. Penny came here for a break, and judging from how busy\
    \ the rest of the staff is, it was probably a much-needed one. If she had been in\
    \ any danger, could she have climbed or jumped down from the balcony? You peer\
    \ over the edge. It’s possible, but unlikely. A fall from here could break a leg,\
    \ or worse. She likely would have retreated back into the manor, where she could\
    \ have called for help...only, nobody saw her exit from the bedroom. Something\
    \ doesn’t add up. You tuck the cigarette butt into your coat pocket, hoping it’s\
    \ actually a lead and not a wild goose chase."

  [ "Tracing Valentino’s steps isn’t difficult. As the guest of honor (and life of\
    \ the party, from what you hear) there was always a crowd around him. This makes\
    \ the story that he “vanished when they weren’t looking” all the more\
    \ unbelievable. In the billiards room, where Valentino was last seen, you corner\
    \ Adam Gensler, the man he was playing billiards with just before his\
    \ disappearance. “Look, I already told the cops and the reporters what I saw,” he\
    \ explains, fidgeting and tapping his toes repeatedly. “Tino and I were playing\
    \ billiards, I looked away, next thing I know he’s gone,” he insists angrily,\
    \ returning to his billiards game. “Now where is that damned one ball?” he\
    \ mutters. It might be nothing, but it looks like Valentino wasn’t the only thing\
    \ to go missing that night."
