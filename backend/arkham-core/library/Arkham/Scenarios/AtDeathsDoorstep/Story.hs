  , "Residents of French Hill are still in a tizzy after the sudden disappearance of\
    \ several guests and house staff from the home of Mr. Josef Meiger during the\
    \ night of the annual Silver Twilight charity gala last Sunday. “We are\
    \ absolutely baffled as to how this could have happened,” said Mr. Meiger the day\
    \ after the disappearances. “That said, we are confident that Sheriff Engle and\
    \ the Arkham Police will do their due diligence in finding the missing persons.”"
  , "There is still no evidence whatsoever as to the whereabouts of Miss Gavriella\
    \ Mizrah, Mr. Jerome Davids, Mr. Valentino Rivas, and Mrs. Penny White, all of\
    \ whom vanished halfway through the event and have not been seen since. The\
    \ police are offering a substantial reward for any person or persons who come\
    \ forward with information related to these disappearances. When asked whether\
    \ the police were considering the case a homicide, Sheriff Engle had this to say:\
    \ “There’s no reason to suspect foul play is involved just yet. However, given\
    \ the circumstances, we have to consider every possibility.” No other attendees\
    \ have come forward with statements concerning the gala, which seemed to finish\
    \ without a hitch despite the disappearances."
  , "So far, none of the prominent members of the Silver Twilight Lodge have\
    \ expressed any concern about the Lodge’s upcoming benefit dinner, which was\
    \ recently moved to the same location: Josef Meiger’s estate in French Hill. “I\
    \ am certain that this event will be a smashing success,” Mr. Meiger told the\
    \ Arkham Advertiser in an interview yesterday. “There is no reason for the fair\
    \ residents of Arkham to worry.”"

    \ files you’ve collected over the last few days concerning the missing persons.\
    \ It has been several days since your experience in the woods. You have tried to\
    \ put it all out of mind, but it is impossible. Every night, you dream of a\
    \ nameless place in the void of space, a faint discordant melody of hypnotizing\
    \ flutes pulling you forward. Now there are others disappearing from the town\
    \ without a trace. The disappearances dance along the edges of your thoughts. No\
    \ reason to worry, you ponder, turning the man’s words over in your head. You\
    \ think of the card reader and her warning, and you wonder if you are simply\
    \ imagining devils where there are none. Regardless, there is only one way to\
    \ know for sure. You pick up the invitation, examining the silver-embossed\
    \ stationary and perfect calligraphy."
