    [ "Onward and onward, your steed carries you into the inky nightmare of the\
      \ void beyond. You dare not turn and look behind you, for you know that what\
      \ you see will likely break your heart, or perhaps your mind. Great polypous\
      \ horrors slide darkly amidst the blackness and loneliness of the cosmos. You\
      \ had hoped to marvel at a beautiful, glimmering array of stars, but instead\
      \ you are left with an empty pit in your stomach, as the unabated vastness of\
      \ the dark, cold universe looms before you. In the distance, a far-off melody\
      \ rings its chords, a melody you could not possibly recreate in your universe\
      \ with any known instrument, nor could your ears interpret its notes were it\
      \ not ringing in your head this very moment."
    , "There is a rush of air as you breach the turret of a nightmarish onyx\
      \ barrier and descend into an infinite cavern of black stone and impossible\
      \ architecture. The music grows as you plunge unswerving through an impossible\
      \ valley, through shoals of shapeless beings, and between things that lurk and\
      \ dance in the blackness beyond. You cannot help but listen to the strange\
      \ music, committing each terrible, dissonant note to memory. No thought or\
      \ dream of humanity can reach you here, in this place that was long ancient\
      \ when Earth was born. You can only hope to guide your steed to the place where\
      \ you must go... The throne upon which Azathoth itself sits."
