    [ "It has been more than twenty-four hours since your companions fell\
      \ asleep. Over the course of the past day, your curiosity has slowly turned\
      \ to concern and then dread. The problems began when one of your friends\
      \ started to toss and turn violently in their sleep. You snapped to attention\
      \ and tried to shake them awake, but it was to no avail. You tried\
      \ everything. Physical contact was no use, and water did nothing but soak\
      \ their clothes and bed fruitlessly. Even opening their eyelids did not wake\
      \ them, and in the process, you noticed that their pupils had fully dilated\
      \ and their eyes were glazed over with a milky-white fog."
    , "You have no idea what this could mean for your friends. Have they\
      \ managed to find their way to the land Virgil Gray described in his\
      \ writings? Or has something more sinister taken root within their minds and\
      \ bodies? Just to be safe, you decide to take your companions to St. Mary’s\
      \ Hospital. If something ails them physically, perhaps the doctors there can\
      \ discern what is wrong. Otherwise, you will simply have to watch over them\
      \ and hope that they return safely to the waking world."
    , "St. Mary’s is the only hospital in the town of Arkham, and it is a\
      \ fixture of its Uptown neighborhood. You explain the situation to Nurse\
      \ Greenberg, the head nurse at the hospital, who instructs several other\
      \ nurses to carry your companions into the emergency ward on stretchers. She\
      \ tells you with a warm, friendly smile that your friends will be examined by\
      \ Doctor Maheswaran, but other than that, you are left entirely in the dark."
    , "Hours pass. You hear nothing about the status of your companions. You\
      \ still have not met with Doctor Maheswaran, and you’re starting to grow\
      \ impatient. You feel something crawling along your arm, and you\
      \ instinctively brush it away, then wonder if it was an insect or a figment\
      \ of your imagination. You begin to question whether bringing your friends\
      \ here was the right choice after all. Eventually, you decide to take matters\
      \ into your own hands."
    , "It is late at night, and the receptionist who instructed you to stay in\
      \ the waiting room is nowhere to be seen. In fact, there are eerily few\
      \ people roaming the halls of the hospital. With nobody to stop you, you\
      \ sneak off into the emergency ward to find your friends. It does not take\
      \ long for you to find their room. Your companions lie asleep on clean, white\
      \ cots, their sleep anything but peaceful. They are pale faced and sweaty.\
      \ One of them tosses and turns in their sleep, their brow furrowed with pain\
      \ or worry."
    , "Doctor Maheswaran does not seem surprised by your intrusion. “Shivani\
      \ Maheswaran,” she introduces herself coldly, without looking up from her\
      \ clipboard. “You’re the ones who brought them in, right? Before you ask: no,\
      \ I’ve never seen anything like this before in my life,” she says with a hint\
      \ of dry impatience. You demand that she tell you everything she knows about\
      \ their condition and not give you the runaround. With a sigh, she puts her\
      \ clipboard down and addresses you frankly. “Listen, I may be new to Arkham,\
      \ but I have seen enough inexplicable maladies in this town to fill entire\
      \ careers in medicine. I understand why you are concerned. Your friends...”\
      \ She struggles to find the right words. “They are not simply asleep. It is\
      \ as if they are hovering somewhere between sleep and unconsciousness, or\
      \ even death. They are not aware of anything happening around them but appear\
      \ to be reacting to some kind of internal stimuli.”"
    , " Without hesitation, you ask if they are dreaming. “Dreaming?” Doctor\
      \ Maheswaran replies. “It is unlikely, though it might account for their\
      \ mannerisms. Honestly—and I know this is not exactly reassuring— none of\
      \ this makes any sense to me, medically speaking.”"
    , "Just then, you see a large, hairy spider crawling on the chest of one of\
      \ your friends. “Well, that is odd.” Doctor Maheswaran brushes the spider\
      \ off, and several more emerge from the sheets to take its place. You and the\
      \ doctor both take several steps back out of pure instinct. You hear heavy\
      \ footsteps in the hallway outside the emergency ward, and then the lights\
      \ begin to flicker. “Okay...that is more than simply odd. What in the world\
      \ is going on out there?” Doctor Maheswaran asks anxiously."
    , "For just a moment, you think you hear one of your sleeping companions\
      \ whisper something. Are they indeed dreaming? And if so, what does their\
      \ condition have to do with these strange events?"

    [ "“Yes, I suppose that makes sense. There has been no change in their\
      \ condition for the past few hours, anyway.” Doctor Maheswaran’s gaze shifts\
      \ nervously to and fro, searching for more spiders. “Also, I’d very much like\
      \ to get out of this room now, so...lead the way,” she adds. You nod and\
      \ venture back into the hospital’s waiting room."

    [ "“Yes, of course. Their safety is paramount. But do come back and tell me\
      \ what is going on, please.” She shivers. “I really hate this place after\
      \ dark...” You nod and venture back into the hospital’s waiting room."
