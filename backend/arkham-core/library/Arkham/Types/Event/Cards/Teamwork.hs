-- | Resolve Teamwork Event
--
-- This event works a little special due to how the interactions work with
-- many players. It is not enough to use ChooseSome because resources can
-- be traded many times. Because of this we introduced the ResolveEvent
-- message which is meant to be an internal message inside events after they
-- have resolved and behavior needs to be handled.
