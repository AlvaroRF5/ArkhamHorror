    \ happy with his colleague’s present choice of company. He’s in the Clover Club,\
    \ a notorious gambling joint somewhere downtown. Finding the club’s exact\
    \ location isn’t easy—you have to grease a few palms just to learn which of the\
    \ Downtown restaurants operates as the club’s front. That restaurant is La\
    \ Bella Luna, a somewhat upscale Italian eatery by the theatre. You change into\
