  [ "Your search of the village of Dunwich has\
    \ uncovered a number of documents, journal entries,\
    \ and esoteric theories. Reading through these\
    \ materials leaves you exhausted and emotionally\
    \ drained. Most of the content was written by\
    \ a single source—a man named Seth Bishop.\
    \ When you ask around town, you learn that Seth\
    \ is a citizen of Dunwich. Along with several others, Seth had witnessed\
    \ firsthand the devastation wrought by the events of “the Dunwich\
    \ horror,” as Armitage had dubbed the incident. Curiously, since that time,\
    \ very few people had seen Seth around town, and those who did claimed\
    \ his eyes had been bloodshot and his face sweaty and pale."
  , "You don’t doubt that somebody who has seen what Seth has seen would\
    \ appear nervous or paranoid. But the more you read of his frantic and\
    \ unhinged writings, the more you believe he is involved in recent events.\
    \ His writings speak of having “gathered the remains” and of using\
    \ arcane methods to “imbue the fathers’ essence” into other creatures, and\
    \ eventually, into other people. The explanations and diagrams that follow\
    \ are unfathomably complex and defy understanding."
  , "Before you are able to find Seth and confront him, several men and\
    \ women from the village approach you in a panic. “It’s back!” one of them\
    \ wails. You recognize him as Curtis Whateley, of the undecayed branch.\
    \ “Whatever it was that killed them Fryes, it’s back! Up and smashed the\
    \ Bishops’ home like it were made o’ paper!” Curtis and the other townsfolk\
    \ are clamoring amongst themselves, raising their voices in a panic."

    \ Glen. “You know what to do, right? You Arkham folk stopped that thing\
