  [ "Recent events in the Museum have forced you to\
    \ re-evaluate Armitage’s tale about Dunwich. It\
    \ cannot be a coincidence—Wilbur Whateley, the\
    \ Necronomicon, the creature from Dunwich, and\
    \ the people and creatures who attacked here in\
    \ Arkham—everything must be connected. You’re\
    \ certain now where you must head: the lonely\
    \ and dismal town of Dunwich Village."
  , "You consider telling the Massachusetts State Police what you know, but\
    \ the negative consequences outweigh the potential gain. Given the nature\
    \ of your story, they would likely write your stories off as an absurd hoax.\
    \ Worse, they could lock you up. After all, you were present in an illegal\
    \ speakeasy, and you also trespassed in the museum. Instead, you decide\
    \ to head to Dunwich yourself, in order to investigate further."
  , "You pack everything you think you might need and manage to get\
    \ some rest for the night. In the morning, you head to the train station in\
    \ Northside and purchase a last-minute express ticket. Dunwich is several\
    \ hours by train northwest along the Miskatonic River Valley. There is no\
    \ train station in Dunwich, but you manage to phone one of Armitage’s\
    \ acquaintances in the small village: a man by the name of Zebulon\
    \ Whateley who was present during the events several months ago."
  , "Armitage’s notes indicate that the Whateley family is spread across\
    \ many branches, some decadent and unscrupulous, others “undecayed”\
    \ or otherwise untouched by nefarious and diabolic rites. According to\
    \ Armitage, Zebulon’s branch of the family lay somewhere between the\
    \ decayed and undecayed Whateleys, who knew of the traditions of his\
    \ ancestors, but was not corrupted by them. He agrees to pick you up at\
    \ the closest station and drive you into town."
  , "As the train departs from Arkham, you feel the events of the previous\
    \ night catching up to you, and exhaustion sets in. But before you can\
    \ safely reach your destination, the train car suddenly rumbles and\
    \ shakes, startling you out of your reverie. The train loudly skids to a\
    \ violent halt, and you hear a rattling noise behind you…"
