  [ "You awaken to the sound of screeching. Fearing\
    \ the worst, you grab your equipment and head\
    \ out into the streets of Dunwich. As soon as you\
    \ step outside, you sense a foulness in the cold night\
    \ air: an awful, pungent smell that can scarcely\
    \ be described and a heaviness to the atmosphere\
    \ that makes it difficult to breathe. The citizens of\
    \ Dunwich have sealed their doors, and the town feels quiet and lonesome.\
    \ In the distance, a faint glow emanates from a hilltop above the village.\
    \ You know of this hill from both your interactions with Zebulon and\
    \ Armitage’s records. It is called Sentinel Hill. The tales speak of satanic\
    \ rites being performed there—rites in which great ritual-pyres light up\
    \ the night sky while the ground rumbles furiously below."
  , "Flocks of whippoorwills perch on the rooftops of the village around you,\
    \ watching ominously as you climb inside Zebulon’s old and beat-up truck.\
    \ As you drive towards Sentinel Hill, more screeching fills the sky with an\
    \ awful pitch that is painful to your ears. Everything you have read about\
    \ and experienced in Dunwich has led to this. If the foul ritual Seth seeks\
    \ to perform has anything to do with what Armitage and his colleagues\
    \ prevented several months back, it involves the favor of an ancient\
    \ creature—Yog‑Sothoth. Failing to stop this ritual may spell doom...not\
    \ only Dunwich, but for the entire world."

  [ "The path leading up Sentinel Hill is narrow and too torn up for\
    \ Zebulon’s truck, so you park at the base of the hill and prepare to make\
    \ the rest of the trip on foot. Just then, you notice that you are not alone.\
    \ Several men and women emerge from the woods behind you, brandishing\
    \ firearms and lining you up in their sights. You raise your hands and brace\
    \ for the worst. “Wait,” one of them says, raising his hand to the others. “I\
    \ recognize you from the Clover Club.” He grins toothily and lowers his\
    \ weapon. “Naomi sends her regards.”"
  , "Curious, you ask what the gangsters are doing here. “Ms. O’Bannion had\
    \ us investigate the attack on her fiancé’s club,” he explains. “Turns out\
    \ there were some men in Arkham behind the whole thing. Some Bishop\
    \ fellow and his lackeys. We tailed them all the way to this dump.” Before\
    \ he can explain further, the all-too-familiar ratta-tat of a tommy gun\
    \ echoes across the hill. “That’ll be Vinny. Come on, boys!” He beckons to\
    \ the others to follow and runs up the hill. Shaking your head, you do the\
    \ same. These mobsters don’t know what they’re getting into."
