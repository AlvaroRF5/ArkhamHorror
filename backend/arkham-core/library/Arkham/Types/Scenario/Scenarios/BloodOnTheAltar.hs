    \ nights ago. ‘Dem whippoorwills won’ shut up.\
    \ Dunno what yer doin’ here, but last time you Arkham folk came ‘round\
    \ it was bad news. Very bad news.” His eyes blink rapidly, and he coughs\
    \ and looks away."
  , "“Look, why don’t you rest fer the night an’ look fer whatever it is yer\
    \ looking fer t’morra,” Zebulon chimes in, putting a wrinkled hand on\
    \ your shoulder. You begin to protest, but your aching muscles and weary\
    \ mind won’t allow you to refuse. The elderly man offers to take you in\
    \ for the night, and drives you to his home at the outskirts of Dunwich\
    \ village. The town is disheveled and eerie, and you find yourself wishing\
    \ you hadn’t come here at all. You fall asleep on the ride over and scarcely\
    \ remember anything else from that night."
  , "When you awaken, you find that Zebulon’s house is abandoned, and\
    \ there is no sign of the elderly man, or of Mr. Sawyer. Fearing the worst,\
    \ you head into the village of Dunwich to investigate, hoping to find\
    \ answers."
