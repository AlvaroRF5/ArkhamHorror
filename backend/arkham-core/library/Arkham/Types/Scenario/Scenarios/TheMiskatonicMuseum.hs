    \ stopped a rampaging horror from tearing\
    \ through Dunwich, a backwater town several\
    \ hours north and west of Arkham. At first you\
    \ imagine this beast as a rabid bear, or worse, but\
    \ the professor’s description of the creature paints\
    \ a different picture."
  , "It all began when a man named Wilbur Whateley entered the Orne\
    \ Library looking for Olaus Wormius’s Latin translation of a book called\
    \ the Necronomicon. Wilbur already possessed a beaten-up English\
    \ translation by Dr. John Dee, but it was insufficient for his purposes.\
    \   Armitage turned the man away, fearing what use the strange man had\
    \ for the book. Whateley returned in secret, hoping to steal the book ,\
    \ but was attacked by a hound guarding the university. Armitage, Rice,\
    \ and Morgan later discovered Whateley’s body. A description of the foul\
    \ corpse—semi-anthropomorphic and covered in fur, with a leathery\
    \ hide and greenish-grey tentacles—causes you to question whether or\
    \ not Whateley was truly human."

    \ the Miskatonic Museum—for safekeeping in the museum’s Restricted\
    \ Hall. Although you are worried about your mentor, you are equally\

    \ imperative that we get our hands on that copy of the Necronomicon.\
    \ If my instincts are correct, the assailants you’ve encountered will be\
    \ searching for it. After all that transpired, I didn’t feel safe keeping it\
    \ at the library, so I brought it to my good friend, Harold Walsted. He is\
    \ the current curator of the Miskatonic Museum. I thought it would be\
    \ safe in the museum’s Restricted Hall, but now I’m not so sure. You must\
