  [ "Sunday, November 22nd, 1925. Arkham, Massachusetts."
  , "Though All Hallows’ Eve is nearly a month past, a grim melancholy lingers\
    \ throughout the town. Each morning, a thick fog permeates the streets. Nights\
    \ are beginning to grow longer, and if you ask around town, you’ll hear people\
    \ swear that it’s getting darker, too. But despite the gloomy mood, progress\
    \ continues in the sleepy town of Arkham. The election of Nathaniel Rhodes to the\
    \ United States Senate has upstanding members of the community feeling optimistic\
    \ about the town’s future. And tonight, at his well-appointed estate in French\
    \ Hill, a man named Josef Meiger hosts the Silver Twilight Lodge’s charity gala,\
    \ an annual members-only event that will turn deadly for several attendees..."

  [ "“Ladies and gentlemen,” Josef Meiger announces, raising a glass of champagne in\
    \ a toast. A hush descends on the room, until only the crackle of the fireplace\
    \ and whispers of gossip can be heard. “Allow me to welcome you all into my home\
    \ for this year’s charity gala. We have some very upstanding citizens here\
    \ tonight, and I thank all of you for your hard work and generosity.” Cheers and\
    \ murmurs of agreement fill the room. Many of the guests raise their glasses to\
    \ Valentino, one of the most esteemed members of the Lodge this year, who sits at\
    \ the Guest of Honor table, which is nearest to the fireplace."
  , "Josef ’s assistant, Jerome, blends into the wall behind Josef, discreetly\
    \ checking his pocket watch. In another corner of the room, the head housekeeper,\
    \ Penny, walks from table to table, filling empty glasses and collecting dirty\
    \ salad plates. “Each of you has done great deeds in the name of the Silver\
    \ Twilight Lodge and our historic city,” Josef continues. “Next year, we will\
    \ continue to shoulder this burden and do what must be done for the sake of\
    \ progress.” Jerome steps forward quietly, interrupting Josef ’s speech with the\
    \ unassuming confidence that comes from years of trusted service. He taps Josef\
    \ lightly on his shoulder and shows him the time. “I’m afraid I am already out of\
    \ time. Thank you all very much for attending,” Josef concludes, bowing. Polite\
    \ applause rises from the audience, and Josef walks briskly toward the parlor,\
    \ followed closely by his assistant. Two servants collect coats as latecomers\
    \ trickle into the manor, and Gavriella—Josef ’s head of security—watches over\
    \ the entrance with hard eyes and a clenched jaw. “Has Mr. Sanford arrived?”\
    \ Josef asks curtly, tapping his polished leather shoe on the floor."
  , "“I’m afraid not,” Jerome replies, flipping through the last pages of the\
    \ estate’s guest book. “But he should be here any minute, Mr. Meiger.”"
  , "“Good. I want there to be no problems whatsoever when he arrives; am I\
    \ understood?” Josef calls out to Gavriella: “Make sure he is well protected.”\
    \ Gavriella nods, patting the handle of her .45 in her shoulder holster. Josef\
    \ turns his attention back to his assistant. “And have Penny make sure the main\
    \ course is kept good and hot while we wait for Mr. Sanford’s arrival. Not a\
    \ single slice is to be served without his presence.”"
  , "“Not even for Mr. Rivas, sir?” Jerome asks, glancing at Josef over the rim of\
    \ his thick glasses. Josef pauses for a moment, considering."
  , "“Pour Mr. Rivas another glass of champagne, and I am sure he will not complain.\
    \ Also, I’m still waiting on those accounts I asked you about earlier today.\
    \ Don’t forget,” Josef says, clapping his assistant on the shoulder before\
    \ walking back into the banquet hall. Jerome nods obediently and heads upstairs."
  , "Soon after, the dark mist would appear, and nothing would be the same."

  ["You stand guard as instructed, waiting for Mr. Sanford to appear. By now, the\
    \ remaining guests have filed into the banquet hall, and you can hear the sounds\
    \ of merriment and drinking coming from beyond the wooden door behind you. You\
    \ pay them no mind, remaining vigilant. Years of fighting and discipline have\
    \ taught you to be ready for anything, even at a harmless banquet like this. Just\
    \ as you begin to ponder whether your talents are being wasted under Mr. Meiger’s\
    \ employ, a dark mist invades the parlor through the front door and the window\
    \ frames, flooding the room. At first, you believe it to be only the evening fog\
    \ seeping through the manor’s entryway, until you begin to notice that everything\
    \ the mist touches seems to have decayed as though aged hundreds of years."
  , "You step back cautiously, keeping a hand on the grip of your weapon just in\
    \ case. Never in all your years have you seen something like this. An unnatural\
    \ chill spreads throughout the room, and shivers run up your spine. As the ashen\
    \ mist finishes pouring in, it coalesces into a singular form: a humanoid figure\
    \ wrapped in shadows. It raises its hand and points at you with a charred,\
    \ blackened finger."
  , "You unholster your firearm and point it at the creature, allowing your training\
    \ to take over. “Don’t come any closer!” you shout. The thing watching you from\
    \ the entrance is unfazed. Its ethereal form begins to glide toward you, dark\
    \ mist crawling over the carpet in its wake.  “I warned you,” you growl, and a\
    \ thunderous shot echoes through the parlor as you squeeze the trigger. The\
    \ bullet rips a hole in the figure’s head like a rush of air billowing through a\
    \ column of smoke. The mist stitches itself together, and the thing continues to\
    \ drift your way, reaching out menacingly."
  , "Nothing could have prepared you for combat with such an unnatural enemy. Faced\
    \ with no other option, you turn and flee up the staircase nearby, pausing to\
    \ squeeze off several more shots at the top. The bullets that make their target\
    \ simply pass harmlessly through the ghostly figure, striking the door behind it.\
    \ A few stray shots shatter a column of the staircase’s wooden balustrade."

  ["You carefully flip through the pages of Mr. Meiger’s ledger, looking for the\
    \ accounts he inquired about. You have served Mr. Meiger faithfully for almost a\
    \ decade, and he trusts you with sensitive information like this—a point of pride\
    \ for you. While you are often curious about your employer’s business, you have\
    \ never pried into his personal matters. Not until tonight, anyway."
  , "You adjust your glasses and lean forward as you turn to the page regarding Mr.\
    \ Meiger’s request. Some of the names on the list you recognize: Rivas, Gensler,\
    \ Fairmont, Rhodes, Wick. But many are names you have never heard of before, let\
    \ alone seen affiliated with Mr. Meiger’s work: Lindquist, Konstantinov, Magro,\
    \ Atkinson, Lamar...Just how deep do Mr. Meiger’s connections go?"
  , "Strange as that may seem, it is the list of names on the page afterward that\
    \ raises your hackles. While it was clear that the names on the previous page are\
    \ associates of Mr. Meiger’s, or at least prominent members of the Lodge, you can\
    \ only assume that this next series of names is of people your employer\
    \ is...targeting. For what, you cannot say."
  , "You stand next to Josef ’s desk and record the list in your pocket journal\
    \ carefully, making sure to keep the names in the exact order they appear in Mr.\
    \ Meiger’s ledger. You hope that your suspicion is nothing more than the absurd\
    \ imagination of an overworked secretary. Still, something about all of this has\
    \ you concerned. That, and the sudden draft of frigid air that has somehow wafted\
    \ into the room. Your gaze naturally drifts to the window, at which point you\
    \ scream out in shock and lose your balance, stumbling backward into Mr. Meiger’s\
    \ desk."
  , "Pressed up against the office window is a host of screaming faces emerging from\
    \ the mist, or perhaps composed of it. Their ghostly hands press against the\
    \ glass, their eyes hollow and empty. Your reading glasses clatter to the ground\
    \ and shatter under your heel as you scramble to the other side of the office.\
    \ You don’t realize that you dropped your pocket journal in the chaos until it is\
    \ too late."

  ["You sigh as the cool New England air embraces you. It has been a very stressful\
    \ night: stressful enough that you’ve decided to sneak away from the clamor to\
    \ grab a quick smoke before heading back to work. You rest your arms along the\
    \ metal railing of the balcony, your fingers trembling as they hold your\
    \ cigarette. The dreary gambrel rooftops and Victorian manors of French Hill span\
    \ the view below you, the unlit windows hiding countless secrets."
  , "You can’t remember a night in which your employer was as concerned with every\
    \ little detail as he is tonight. He is normally so calm, so collected. There’s\
    \ something special about tonight that has him on edge. Is it Mr. Sanford? A\
    \ shudder crawls through you. For some reason, something about that man gives you\
    \ the creeps. But Josef has interacted with Mr. Sanford many times before, so\
    \ that cannot be the reason. What could it be that has Mr. Meiger so worried?"
  , "You are torn from your thoughts by the gathering of grey clouds overhead,\
    \ swiftly blotting out the night sky. As the clouds grow ever closer, you begin\
    \ to see shapes emerging from the vapor. You squint and lean over the railing for\
    \ a better view. That is when you notice the true forms of the shapes in the\
    \ mist: their screaming faces, their clawing hands, all writhing in torment and\
    \ coming straight for you. You cry out in terror and back up against the wall as\
    \ the mist envelops the building. A spectral shape emerges from the haze beyond\
    \ the railing, dressed in bloodstained rags. It begs for rest in a croaking,\
    \ gasping voice. Your only hope for escape is to retreat back into the manor and\
    \ call for help..."

  [ "“Are you going to break, or are you going to sit there admiring the cue ball\
    \ all night?” you ask with a mocking smile. Your opponent sets the ivory ball\
    \ back on the table with a sigh."
  , "“I can’t help myself around ivory. You know that, Tino,” Adam replies. You\
    \ rarely see Adam Gensler except during Lodge functions, but you prefer his\
    \ company to that of the stuffy business types who make up most of the Lodge\
    \ these days. He makes his shot, the sudden clattering interrupting the din of\
    \ conversation. “Your shot, Tino. And do try to avoid hitting the nine ball\
    \ first. You’re always so overeager.” Adam chuckles as he moves to the other side\
    \ of the table, making way for you."
  , "“That was one time, my friend, one time.” You roll your eyes. Truth be told,\
    \ you’ve enjoyed coming to these events for the opportunity to give back to the\
    \ community, not to hobnob with Arkham’s gentry. But hobnobbing has had its\
    \ perks."
  , "You lean over the table and clear your mind as you line up your shot. The room\
    \ falls silent as you block out the clamor and the music, focusing all of your\
    \ attention on the one ball and the corner pocket. You hold your breath and\
    \ strike the cue ball. It clacks as it hits its target, and the one ball drops\
    \ effortlessly into the corner pocket. “There, you see?”"
  , "It is only then that you realize the silence around you is not just in your\
    \ mind. All of the light and warmth has been sucked out of the room. Adam is\
    \ gone, along with everyone else who was present just moments before you took\
    \ your shot. “Hello?” you call out. A dark mist coils about your ankles as you\
    \ walk around the billiards table. “If this is a practical joke of some kind,\
    \ it’s in awfully poor taste,” you remark. The only response is the deep growl\
    \ that emerges from beneath the table. Morbid curiosity compels you to look\
    \ underneath it, at which point a dark hound pounces onto your chest, savagely\
    \ clawing at your torso. You react instinctively, pushing it off of your body as\
    \ hard as you can. It lands on the billiards table, causing it to collapse under\
    \ the creature’s weight. You slowly back up as the creature rises to its feet\
    \ once again and jumps off the broken table, its hollow eyes gazing into your\
    \ soul."
