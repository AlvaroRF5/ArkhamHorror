  , "There will be no rest for us this summer, it seems."
  , "Today I met with Harlan Earnstone, a historical theorist at Miskatonic\
    \ University and an old friend of mine. He’d said he had a job offer for\
    \ me, but frankly, I didn’t know what to expect."
  , "Harlan introduced me to an associate of his: Alejandro Vela, a\
    \ distinguished historian from across the southern border. Mr. Vela is\
    \ a graduate of a prestigious university in Mexico City, and has spent\
    \ many years researching the Aztec Empire. He claims that he has found\
    \ evidence regarding the existence of an unheard-of Aztec city-state called\
    \ Eztli. His strange and unprecedented findings were not accepted by the\
    \ university, and he’s become a pariah among his peers."
  , "Alejandro came to Arkham to seek funding for an expedition into the\
    \ rainforests of southern Mexico, where he believes that the ruins of the\
    \ Eztli altepetl lie undiscovered. His description of this city-state’s origins\
    \ defies modern understanding of Mesoamerican history. Despite this—\
    \ or, knowing my old friend, because of this—Harlan is enthralled by\
    \ Alejandro’s discoveries. Miskatonic University has agreed to fund the\
    \ expedition (albeit meagerly), and Harlan wants me to go along."
  , "The way I see it, there’s a good chance we’re looking for something that\
    \ doesn’t even exist. But if there’s even a slight chance these Eztli people\
    \ existed, the historical significance would be profound. We debated\
    \ the issue for some time, but in the end, we accepted Alejandro’s offer.\
    \ Preparations are underway, and we should be setting off by the end of\
    \ the month. With any luck, we’ll have this journal filled with all manner\
    \ of interesting discoveries. If not, perhaps it’ll be a nice wedge to place\
    \ beneath Harlan’s lopsided desk."

    \ rested, my mind was plagued by nightmares. A cavern like a gaping maw, bathed\
    \ in dim red light...the walls slithering with the glimmering scales of a hundred\
    \ vipers...it might have been better had I not slept at all."

  [ "Those nights in the jungle, I barely slept. A strange fog rolled through the\
    \ camp each night, plunging the area in an intense and peculiar cold. My bedroll\
    \ offered some protection against the elements, but we hadn’t been prepared for\
    \ this unnatural weather. Flies and mosquitoes buzzed in my ears every time I\
    \ began to drift off. Even when I finally slept, I would soon be startled awake\
    \ by the crawling of an insect or lizard across my face. I wager I’ll get very\
    \ little sleep on this journey..."

    \ by the rustling of tree branches along the southern border of our camp’s\
    \ clearing. Despite the darkness, I was able to use my binoculars to see shapes\
    \ moving in the trees. The shapes appeared human, but...why? Why do they only\
    \ watch us from afar? What is their purpose?"

    \ out from the inky darkness that surrounded our camp. They knew we were there.\
    \ The yellow eyes watched me, alert, my weapons drawn, ready to defend the camp\
    \ if the need arose. Our eyes met, and a darkness seized my heart."
