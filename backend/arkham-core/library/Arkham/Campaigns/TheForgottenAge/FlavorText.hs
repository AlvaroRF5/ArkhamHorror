  , "Today I met with Harlan Earnstone, a historical theorist at Miskatonic\
    \ University and an old friend of mine. He’d said he had a job offer for\
    \ me, but frankly, I didn’t know what to expect."
  , "Harlan introduced me to an associate of his: Alejandro Vela, a\
    \ distinguished historian from across the southern border. Mr. Vela is\
    \ a graduate of a prestigious university in Mexico City, and has spent\
    \ many years researching the Aztec Empire. He claims that he has found\
    \ evidence regarding the existence of an unheard-of Aztec city-state called\
    \ Eztli. His strange and unprecedented findings were not accepted by the\
    \ university, and he’s become a pariah among his peers."
  , "Alejandro came to Arkham to seek funding for an expedition into the\
    \ rainforests of southern Mexico, where he believes that the ruins of the\
    \ Eztli altepetl lie undiscovered. His description of this city-state’s origins\
    \ defies modern understanding of Mesoamerican history. Despite this—\
    \ or, knowing my old friend, because of this—Harlan is enthralled by\
    \ Alejandro’s discoveries. Miskatonic University has agreed to fund the\
    \ expedition (albeit meagerly), and Harlan wants me to go along."
  , "The way I see it, there’s a good chance we’re looking for something that\
    \ doesn’t even exist. But if there’s even a slight chance these Eztli people\
    \ existed, the historical significance would be profound. We debated\
    \ the issue for some time, but in the end, we accepted Alejandro’s offer.\
    \ Preparations are underway, and we should be setting off by the end of\
    \ the month. With any luck, we’ll have this journal filled with all manner\
    \ of interesting discoveries. If not, perhaps it’ll be a nice wedge to place\
    \ beneath Harlan’s lopsided desk."

    \ this unnatural weather. Flies and mosquitoes buzzed in my ears every time I\

    \ starry-eyed idealism after the hell we went through in the jungle is beyond me.\
    \ His attention is fixated on the strange relic that we discovered in the\
    \ ruins. I wish we knew a little more about the artifact’s origins. It unsettles\
    \ me greatly. It hums at all times and pulses with an otherworldly energy I can\
    \ scarcely describe. As we traveled home with the artifact in tow, our nights\
    \ were plagued by bizarre nightmares: dreams of other worlds and civilizations."
  , "Alejandro wants to bring the relic to the Miskatonic Museum, to put on display\
    \ along with the other Eztli artifacts we discovered. My feelings are mixed. At\
    \ the museum, it will receive proper care, and historians will be able to study\
    \ it and perhaps even discern its purpose. However, I fear that the relic may be\
    \ too dangerous for the public. After all, we still have no idea what the damned\
    \ thing even is. Alejandro would hate it, but perhaps it would be better to keep\
    \ the relic somewhere safe, where Harlan and I can study it in private. I’ll have\
    \ to decide tonight; after tomorrow, there won’t be time to change my mind..."

    \ cavernous depths. When I walk through the streets, I find myself drawn toward\

    \ expedition managed to grab it from the camp before fleeing the jungle. I think\
    \ if you read these entries, you’ll understand what I mean. The things they\

    \ glasses with too-shaky hands. “I am concerned not only for Alejandro, but for\
    \ all of us. Read this journal, and if you can, please keep an eye on my\
    \ colleague.” You agree to help, but his worry does not fade. “I only hope that I\

    \ mind, and you realize at once who she must be. After all, you’ve read and\
