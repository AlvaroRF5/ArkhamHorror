{- | Get a set aside card

Some cards may be double sided and completely different types
like Daniel Chesterfield. In these cases, we want to consider
the card a match, but "flip" it to the correct side.

This logic is a bit too generous and we may want to specify
on double sided cards which card code is on the other side.
